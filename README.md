## Deployment

How to set yourself up to use Django:

If you don't have python installed, you're gonna have to do that first.

Then navigate to whichever folder you would like to work in from powershell if you are on windows
```
python -m venv env

env\Scripts\Activate

pip install django
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DalglishJeremy/AgileSWGroup4.git

cd AgileSWGroup4
```
From there you should be good to go, you can enter the repository, and run 
```bash
python manage.py runserver 
```
to run the django site locally, at the moment there isn't anything developed. Going to the local address /sports will take you to a basic html page, going to /admin will take you to Django's default admin page
